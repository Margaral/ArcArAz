Loosely coupled GIS-Hydrogeological modeling tools

Abstract: 
GIS technology gives a wide-ranging support to environmental modeling, especially to groundwater modeling. 
Numerous GIS applications have been developed to define the hydrogeological conceptual model as well as the numerical model. 
However, there is a scarcity of tools to implement the conceptual model in numerical modeling platforms. 
This transition needs of specific methodologies to adapt the geometries and alpha-numerical data from the conceptual model 
to the numerical model to get optimal numerical results. 
Although most necessities can be satisfied with inherent GIS tools, there are particular steps in the implementation of 
hydrogeological conceptual model into the numerical modeling software that have not been solved yet. 
They are mostly related with finite element mesh generation. 
To overcome this gap, we present a set of tools, named ArcArAz, focuses on the configuration of geometry and 
parameterization for groundwater numerical models, which can be used in other environmental sciences.

Keywords: loose coupling approach, hydrogeological numerical model, mesh generation

Highlights:
GIS-based conceptual models can be implemented into numerical models
File exchange between GIS and numerical model is accomplished with shapefiles
Geometries are modified to facilitate generation of valid finite element meshes.
